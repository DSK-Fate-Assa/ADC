    <h2>How can organizations reduce their emissions? </h2>

    <h3> 6.Optimise your heating and cooling systems </h3>
    <p>
      Implement temperature controls, ensuring heating and air conditioning is timed correctly and according to outside air temperatures. This can minimise over heating or cooling. Ensuring that temperature is minimal during the night is important. Lots of energy can be wasted if heating and cooling systems are competing, this can be avoided by installing a Building Management system.

      Ensure staff are trained on local heating and cooling units to avoid dramatic swings in temperature or take away the ability to manually adjust the thermostat. Train or take away locally controlled thermostats and have them centrally controlled. Make sure your boiler is regularly serviced to ensure it is operating as efficiently as possible. In addition, regularly clean fins on heating and cooling appliances.

      Consider installing window film that allows light in but reflects the heat back out during the summer. This gives you the benefit of natural light without causing increased need for air conditioning. This film can be reversed in winter so that heat is reflected into the room.

    <h3>7. Reduce, reuse, recycle</h3>
    <p>
      Thinking about sustainable procurement can act as an exercise to engage employees by thinking of ways they can reduce consumption of items such as water, paper, food and drink, laptops, phones and packaging. Manufacture and transport of all these items has an associated carbon footprint.

      Purchasing recycled paper or refurbished phones and IT equipment is an easy way to reduce your businesses carbon footprint. Buying recycled paper instead of primary production reduces carbon emissions as stipulated by the GHG Protocol. If your business has a large supply chain, then it is particularly important to ensure that sustainability is fed right through.

    <h3>8. Minimise emissions from food and food waste</h3>
    <p>
      Food takes a significant amount of energy to produce and transport it. Therefore, food waste can be a source of carbon, particularly if your business has a canteen serving fresh food daily. Check with your waste contractor if food waste collection is possible.

      Ensure that kitchen staff are all trained and aware of the issue, and provide proper facilities, in kitchens, dining rooms and canteens for employees to dispose of any food waste they may have. Additionally, it is worth looking into food waste apps like Olio, for example.

      If your business has a canteen or café it is worth making sure you have vegan and vegetarian options available to encourage staff to choose to eat food with fewer associated carbon emissions. 18% of global emissions are associated with livestock agriculture. Providing employees with good vegan and vegetarian food can help to reduce your businesses carbon footprint.

    <h3>9. Minimise single use plastic </h3>
    <p>
      By introducing sustainable procurement policies as suggested above, your plastic waste will be reduced. The next step to reduce plastic is to look at removing all single use plastic items you’re your business model.

      Be cautious of biodegradable or compostable materials as many of them can’t be combined with food waste. 

    </p>
    <h3> 10. Print as minimally as possible </h3>
    <p>
      Many offices consume vast amounts of paper. Take action to cut down paper usage, especially by reducing printing, and digitising (e.g. online contract signings, avoiding printing emails, presentations and annotating on screen instead).

      If printing is required, ensure double sided printing is set as a default. Having ‘follow me’ printing services across office printers can also help cut down any accidental or unnecessary printing as options can be altered at the time of printing.
