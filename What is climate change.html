      Climate is the average weather in a place over many years. Climate change is a shift in those average conditions.
The Earth is now in a period of rapid climate change, with global temperatures rising.

    <h2>Greenhouse gasses </h2>
    <p>
      A greenhouse gas (GHG) is any gas in the atmosphere that absorbs and emits radiation in the thermal infrared range. These are the fundamental cause of the greenhouse effect, which results in increased temperatures on Earth.
 
      The greenhouse effect occurs as the gases reach Earthâ€™s surface. As the short wave energy heats the surface, some of the longer wave energy radiates back into the atmosphere and back into space. Greenhouse gases absorb some of the energy and trap it in the lower atmosphere. Less heat radiates into space, and Earth is warmer.
 
      Many greenhouse gases occur naturally. Carbon dioxide, methane, water vapor, and nitrous oxide are naturally present in Earth's atmosphere. Others, such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), are human made.

    <h2>What evidence is there that CO2 levels are increasing?

</h2>
    <p>
      Since 1958, CO2 has been measured at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii. In 1958, the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere was measured at 316ppm, as of May 2016 it was 407ppm. Before the industrial revolution began (1880s), the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere was measured at 280ppm and so in just 130 years, CO2 concentrations have increased by 45%.

      By comparison CO2 emissions, in the past 800,000 years before the industrial revolution, had fluctuated between 180ppm (when the Earth was in an ice age) to a maximum of 280ppm (in a warmer interglacial) period. Never in recent geological history and during the time in which humans have been on the Earth has the atmospheric CO2 concentration been as high as it is today.
